Tool for measuring DCI metric help

=============================
How to use it?
=============================
1) You can start the application by double clicking on the application file.
    
Use correct one for your system.
DCIMetric-exe.jar represents the version for Mac OS
DCIMetric.exe represents the version for Windows

2) After starting the application, start with choosing the WSDL file you 
   want to measure.

For this, "WSDL URL/File" labeled input field is used.

For WSDL file that is located on your file system you can click on the blue 
folder icon to start file browser/finder for locating the file using GUI 
interface. For WSDL file that is located on the web, insert URL pointing
to required WSDL file.

Click in "Add button" to submit using the file for calculation. You can repeat
this step as many times as you want.

3) Calculate the metric

Use the "Calculate metric!" button to calculate the metric using all the loaded
WSDL files.

4) Analyze the results

=============================
Results 
=============================
First, basic result data are shown. You can see other view by clicking on
the tabs.

Basic results tab:
DCI - the value of data coupling index
NDCI - the value of normalized data coupling index
Total number of service operations - number of service operations used for 
calculation.
Total number of combination - the "r" value from the DCI formula.
The average number of complex types per operation - including anonymous 
complex types.
Number of complex types that were reused - number of non-anonymous complex 
types that were used in more than one interface .

Operation interfaces tab:
This tab contains information about every service interface
Number of distinct complex types - includes anonymous complex types
Non-anonymous - a list of non anonymous complex types used in the interface
Out of them shared - number of shared non anonymous complex types

Complex types tab:
Contains names of all non anonymous complex types used by the operation
interfaces with the number of usages.

Operation combinations:
Number and list of shared non anonymous complex types for each operation 
interface.

=============================
Old command line interface
=============================
You can still use the old command line interface.

Run the application from command line via standard java command with "-cli" 
argument:

java -jar DCIMetric-exe.jar -cli

First, you will be asked to provide a URI to WSDL definition you want to analyze. 
This file can be located either on your local computer, or on the internet.

For local WSDL file, use URI in following form (you can use both relative and 
absolute links):
file:path/to/my/local/file.wsdl

For remote WSDL file, use URI in following form:
http://www.somedomain.com/file.wsdl

After loading the WSDL, you will be asked for inserting another URI to load next 
WSDL. If you do not want to load any other WSDL, you can proceed to the calculation 
by inserting blank line.

Next, the DCI metric is calculated and following values are provided:

---------------------------------
DCI  = x.xxx
NDCI = x.xxx
---------------------------------

Additional information:
Total number of service operations:            xx
Total number of combinations (r):              xx

Average number of complex types per operation: xx
Number of complex types that were reused:      xx

For more detailed analysis, you can use additional options as described in program 
output. You can press q and enter to exit the program.

You can press 1 and enter for detailed analysis of operation interfaces.
You can press 2 and enter for detailed analysis of complex types.
You can press 3 and enter for detailed analysis of each operation interface combination.
